       <h1>What Your Support Does</h1> 

       <p> Every 10 minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer. Her first reaction 
        is fear and confusion. Support is just a phone call or mouse click away. Our 
        free services offer a friendly ear and expert guidance to anyone dealing with 
        this life-threatening illness.</p>
        
       <p>By running or walking with us, you can ensure 
         that we are there when people need us. Here is how your contribution can 
        help:</p>
        
       <ul> <strong>$</strong>15 pays for a headscarf set, boosting the confidence of 
        women who have lost their hair from her breast cancer treatment.
        
        <strong>$</strong>50 trains a member of our support network for a 
        year to help improve the care of women with breast cancer.
        
        <strong>$</strong>125 covers the cost of counselling sessions to help 
        women cope with the distress of their cancer treatment.
        
        $250 funds a hospital information station 
        for a year so that people affected by breast cancer have easy 
        access to the latest resources and help.</ul>
